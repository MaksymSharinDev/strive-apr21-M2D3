# strive-apr21-M2D3
Pair Coding project with Mykola Kravchenko 

Demo: [strive-apr21-m2d3.netlify.app](https://strive-apr21-m2d3.netlify.app)

Work-flow notes:

- Maksym's conversion from functional to Technical Requirements
- Mykola's Technical Requirements Revision
- Mykola Story Points Estimates
- Maybe we spent too much time on Analisys than code&deliver features
  - that can be changed to do analisys with an incremental approach like Analisys 10 mins, Code 20 mins, reapeat   
- We focused to deliver decent looking UI and Code instead of be pushy about doing  most exercise possible 
- Good amount of time spend on knowlage sharing as by-product of experience off-set
- Internet connection, screenshare and machine environment difference was the main Bottlenecks for this session
- Absence of git tool confidence needed an 1t1 session    
- Common language spook at good level by both was an asset
